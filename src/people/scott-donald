Suddenly thrust into two management/administrative positions with a projected doubling in company size in the near horizon, I had little choice but to automate my way out of the mountain of work. This quickly turned into a love affair with Google Workspace and Google Apps Script. In Octber of 2017, I created www.yagisanatode.com to keep track of my automation and Google Workspace solutions. This soon evolved into a tutorial and tooling website for Google Workspace users and devs. In October 2020, I left my full-time job to work on Yagisanatode and consult for small and medium businesses working in or planning to work in Google Workspace. I can honestly say that I love my job.
